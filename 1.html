<p>There were two places I wanted to go the most in the west.</p>
In fact, I tried to travel only to the east, but I came to the west because of these two,<br>
one is the <u>Supungseok Museum</u>, and the other is the <u>Kim Changyeol Museum of Art.</u>
<p>I thought I only had to make a reservation a few days before I went to the Supungseok Museum,
but when I went to the website, it was full until December, and I went to the official reservation site because I wanted to visit the Kim Changyeol Museum,
but the site itself was not included.</p>
I even borrowed a staff laptop here and tried it, and I called him when I woke up in the morning of the same day,
but I couldn't make a reservation, so I just gave up and traveled freely with the guests.
